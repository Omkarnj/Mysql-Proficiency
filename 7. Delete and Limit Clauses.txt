The MySQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax -

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

SQL DELETE Example
The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:

Example  - 

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

DELETE FROM table_name;


---------------------------------------------------

LIMIT CLAUSE 

The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

LIMIT Syntax -

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;

MySQL LIMIT Examples
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table:

Example - 

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;

What if we want to select records 4 - 6 (inclusive)?

MySQL provides a way to handle this: by using OFFSET.

The SQL query below says "return only 3 records, start on record 4 (OFFSET 3)":

Example -

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;


ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany":

Example - 

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
