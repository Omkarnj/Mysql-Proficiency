What is a NULL Value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.
A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead :

IS NULL Syntax -

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax - 

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The MySQL UPDATE Statement

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax - 

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated.


UPDATE Table
The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.

Example

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City = 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;


UPDATE Multiple Records
It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.

The following SQL statement will update the PostalCode to 00000 for all records where country is "Mexico":

Example

UPDATE Customers
SET PostalCode = 00000
WHERE Country = 'Mexico';
